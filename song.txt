Sun went down, sun went down, over Pompeii
On both sides the vow was broken
Oh my my, I'm the one
Tryin' to hide this damage done
One day, all our secrets will be spoken

As we slow danced, I became your statue, frozen
Times I wonder, are we just a puff of smoke? Yeah
Underneath this bed of ashes still withholding everything
Like we were never close
